Sorry when I enter in the gif into the code it doesn't work so here is the link for 
it: https://imgur.com/a/hoCMhiP . One thing I noticed is that it mentions we have 
to be able to view the last 20 posts as well as the log in. My app is able to do 
the two but I just didn't make a new account and I didn't make the 20 different 
posts, if the code is looked at. Let me know if I need to remake the gif. Thank you!
